# EJS Partials

+ Reuse the same HTML across multiple views.
+  partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain 
+ you don’t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. 
+  define that reusable bundle of code in a file and include it wherever you need it.

***Note:*** _The <%- %> tags allow us to output the unescaped content onto the page (notice the -). This is important when using the include() statement since you don’t want EJS to escape your HTML characters like ‘<’, ‘>’, etc…_

+ creating and including partials is very straightforward with EJS. 

*You don't need to include a DOCTYPE and HTML tag in the Partials file because it would be included with them in tha HTML files that they would be called in*
