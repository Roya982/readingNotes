# Sending form data

Once the form data has been validated on the client-side, it is okay to submit the form.

## Client/server architecture

The web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows:

1. A client: sends a request to a server 

 >using the HTTP protocol. 

2. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

The < form > element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are action and method.

## The action attribute

The action attribute defines where the data gets sent.

**Note:** *It's possible to specify a URL that uses the HTTPS (secure HTTP) protocol. When you do this, the data is encrypted along with the rest of the request, even if the form itself is hosted on an insecure page accessed using HTTP. On the other hand, if the form is hosted on a secure page but you specify an insecure HTTP URL with the action attribute, all browsers display a security warning to the user each time they try to send data because the data will not be encrypted.*

## The method attribute

The method attribute defines how data is sent.

**Note:** *Each time you want to reach a resource on the Web, the browser sends a request to a URL. An HTTP request consists of two parts: a header that contains a set of global metadata about the browser's capabilities, and a body that can contain information necessary for the server to process the specific request.*

## The GET method


The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource.

**Note:** *The data is appended to the URL as a series of name/value pairs. After the URL web address has ended, we include a question mark (?) followed by the name/value pairs, each one separated by an ampersand (&). In this case we are passing two pieces of data to the server.*

## The POST method

The POST method the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request
