# Database Normalization

process used to organize a database into tables and columns.

The idea is that a table should be about a specific topic and that only those columns which support that topic are included.

### Reasons for Normalization

+ to minimize duplicate data.
+ to minimize or avoid data modification issues
+ to simplify queries

### There are three modification anomalies that can occur:

+ Insert Anomaly

we cannot record a new sales office until we also know the sales person. Why? Because in order to create the record, we need provide a primary key.

+ Update Anomaly

The same information is recorded in multiple rows, if one of the values changed, then there are multiple updates that need to be made. If these updates are not successfully completed across all rows, then an inconsistency occurs.

+ Deletion Anomaly

Deletion of a row can cause more than one set of facts to be removed.

## Definition of Normalization

There are three common forms of normalization: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal form.

+ ***First Normal Form :*** *The information is stored in a relational table and each column contains atomic values, and there are not repeating groups of columns.*

+ ***Second Normal Form :*** *The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the tableâ€™s primary key.*

+ ***Third Normal Form :*** *The table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.*
